**Removal of invite causes error**
When I try to remove an invitation, the toast shows the following error:
Failed to cancel invitation
Unexpected end of JSON inpu

**Event Calendar Card**
On the event calendar card, when there’s a pending invite, it shows a clock icon with the count of pending invitations next to the name. I don’t want that there; I want nothing displayed.

It’s not necessary. When you open the card, you can see the pending invitation.

**Manage Members Modal**
In the row with pending invitations, we need to remove the pill next to the Resend button that says “Pending.” It’s redundant; the header already addresses this.
