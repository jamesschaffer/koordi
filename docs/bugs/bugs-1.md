**Auto Load New Calendar Events**
When we create our calendars, they do not automatically sync. You need to go back into the calendar and click the Sync button to load the events.

They should load automatically afterward.

**Update Member Invite Status Count**
Earlier, we removed the counts of the different invite statuses header that runs about the input for the email. I don't know how this slipped through.

I need to check all of the member invite modals in the app and make sure the status counts for the invites are removed. They're unnecessary.

**Enable email invites**
We need to enable email sending for new member invites. Right now, they are not being sent.
